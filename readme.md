## Development

## Getting started

1. Ensure you have installed all the prerequisites as described in Fitbit's [Getting Started](https://dev.fitbit.com/getting-started/) guide.
2. From the project root, run `npm install` to install the necessary modules (as described in [here](https://dev.fitbit.com/build/guides/command-line-interface/#updating-existing-projects)).
3. Run `npx fitbit` to build the project and install it on your device or simulator (make sure the simulator is already running if you want to use it).
